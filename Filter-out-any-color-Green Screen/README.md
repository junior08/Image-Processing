# Color Filtering

Run the script and filter out specific colors, upon running the script you will get a tab which has scrollable pegs, using them the size of the window can be adjusted and upon adjusting the HSV values, something similar to a green-screen can be created.

We get the values from the trackbar and apply them to our frame and use Median Blur to remove salt-pepper noise.
