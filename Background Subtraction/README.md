# Background Subtractor

Run the code and see your background vanish!
Lighting may affect the code and the blurring could be varied to make the application better.
We use MOG2 background subtractor, other available aternatives are - BackgroundSubtractorGMG, BackgroundSubtractorMOG.

## This is the end result!
